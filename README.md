# readability-php

A PHP implementation of Arc90's Readability.

## About

This is a fork of [vaguelyexciting/laravel-readability](https://github.com/vaguelyexciting/laravel-readability) which is a fork of [feelinglucky/php-readability](https://github.com/feelinglucky/php-readability).

alextyrey/readability-php is no more than a cleaned up revision of the library contained in the previously mentioned repos.

Being a lone class, it is completely framework agnostic.

### Testing?
Maybe someday if I decide to actively maintain and improve upon the code.
